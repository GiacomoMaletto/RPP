# RPP

RPP stands for Reversible Primitive Permutations. 
It is a class of reversible functions which is complete w.r.t. the class of Primitive Recursive functions. 
RPP has been introduced in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304397519307558 .

The repository contains:
- G. Maletto's BSc Thesis "A Formal Verification of Reversible Primitive Permutations." , defended at Dipartimento di Matematica â€“ Torino, October 2021;
- The scientific article that will appear in the proceedings of the conference "Reversible Computation 2022 (ttps://reversible-computation-2022.github.io/)";
- The LEAN source code that fully formalizes RPP and the proof that it is a class complete w.r.t. the class of Primitive Recursive functions, 
fixing some bugs in the original proof, improving it, and suggesting some programming reversible pattern;
- Preliminary and explorative versions of the same code, written in Coq.
