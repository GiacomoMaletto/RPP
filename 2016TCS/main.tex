\begin{abstract}

We focus on total functions in the theory of reversible computational models.
We define a class of recursive permutations, dubbed
Reversible Primitive Permutations ($ \RPP $) which are
computable invertible total endo-functions on integers, 
so a subset of total reversible computations.
$ \RPP $ is generated from five basic functions (identity, 
sign-change, successor, predecessor, swap),
two notions of composition (sequential and parallel), one functional iteration 
and one functional selection.
$ \RPP $ is closed by inversion and it is expressive enough to encode Cantor pairing and the whole 
class of Primitive Recursive Functions.
