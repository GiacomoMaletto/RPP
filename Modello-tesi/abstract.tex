%This dissertation details our research on anomaly detection techniques, that are central to several classic security-related tasks such as network monitoring, but it also have broader applications such as program behavior characterization or malware\index{malware} classification. In particular, we worked on anomaly detection from three different perspective, with the common goal of recognizing awkward activity on computer infrastructures. In fact, a computer system has several weak spots that must be protected to avoid attackers to take advantage of them. We focused on protecting the operating system, central to any computer, to avoid malicious code to subvert its normal activity. Secondly, we concentrated on protecting the web applications, which can be considered the modern, shared operating systems; because of their immense popularity, they have indeed become the most targeted entry point to violate a system. Last, we experimented with novel techniques with the aim of identifying related events (e.g., alerts reported by intrusion detection systems) to build new and more compact knowledge to detect malicious activity on large-scale systems.

%Our contributions regarding host-based protection systems focus on characterizing a process' behavior through the system calls invoked into the kernel. In particular, we engineered and carefully tested different versions of a multi-model detection system using both stochastic and deterministic models to capture the features of the system calls during normal operation of the operating system. Besides demonstrating the effectiveness of our approaches, we confirmed that the use of finite-state, deterministic models allow to detect deviations from the process' control flow with the highest accuracy; however, our contribution combine this effectiveness with advanced models for the system calls' arguments resulting in a significantly decreased number of false alarms.
%
%Our contributions regarding web-based protection systems focus on advanced training procedures to enable learning systems to perform well even in presence of changes in the web application source code --- particularly frequent in the Web 2.0 era. We also addressed data scarcity issues that is a real problem when deploying an anomaly detector to protect a new, never-used-before application. Both these issues dramatically decrease the detection capabilities of an intrusion detection system but can be effectively mitigated by adopting the techniques we propose.
%
%Last, we investigated the use of different stochastic and fuzzy models to perform automatic alert correlation, which is as post processing step to intrusion detection. We proposed a fuzzy model that formally defines the errors that inevitably occur if time-based alert aggregation (i.e., two alerts are considered correlated if they are close in time) is used. This model allow to account for measurements errors and avoid false correlations due to delays, for instance, or incorrect parameter settings. In addition, we defined a model to describe the alert generation as a stochastic process and experimented with non-parametric statistical tests to define robust, zero-configuration correlation systems.
%
%The aforementioned tools have been tested over different datasets --- that are thoroughly documented in this document --- and lead to interesting results.
